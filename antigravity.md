# Antigravity Guidelines

This file contains foundational instructions and conventions for developing in this repository. AI agents and developers must strictly adhere to these rules.

## 1. Directory Structure
- The `src` directory is strictly reserved for the core logic of the application. 
- Do not place auxiliary code in `src`. Place supporting files in meaningfully named directories (e.g., `utilities`, `scripts`, `data_generation`, `sql`).
- Maintain a separate `tests` directory for unit and integration tests to keep the core codebase clean.

## 2. Dependencies
- Always maintain a `requirements.txt` file at the root of the project.
- Any time a new Python dependency is introduced, it must be explicitly added to `requirements.txt` with appropriate version pinning to ensure reproducible builds.

## 3. Environment Execution
- Execute local scripts using the Conda `myenv` environment to ensure consistency across local development setups.
- Provide clear instructions in the `README.md` if the Conda environment requires updating due to new dependencies.

## 4. Code Quality & Formatting
- Avoid hardcoding paths without environment checks; use relative paths or standard library path resolution (e.g., `pathlib`).
- Use the standard Python `logging` module instead of `print()` statements for proper log leveling, observability, and debugging.
- Implement Python type hinting (PEP 484) across all function signatures and class definitions to improve readability and catch type errors early.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.

## 5. Language & Documentation Style
- **Tone:** Maintain a sober, objective, and professional tone across all documentation (including `README.md`).
- **Vocabulary:** Use only as many adjectives as strictly required. Do not use superlatives (e.g., "fastest", "best", "most") or filler words.
- **Docstrings:** All modules, classes, and public functions must include clear, structured docstrings (e.g., Google-style) detailing their purpose, arguments, and return types.
- **Table of Content:** All markdown files should have a table of content if they contain more than one headline

## 6. Linting & Validation
- Code must pass standard Python linting and formatting checks (e.g., `ruff`, `flake8`, or `black`) before being finalized.
- Always verify that configuration files (e.g., `.yml` or `.json` files) remain structurally compliant and correctly reflect any changes made to the codebase (such as script renames or moving files).

## 7. Security Best Practices
- Never hardcode secrets, passwords, or API keys in the repository. Always rely on environment variables or a `.env` file (ensure `.env` is included in `.gitignore`).

## 8. Error Handling
- Use specific exception handling (`try...except` blocks) instead of catching generic `Exception`s where possible, and provide informative error messages.
